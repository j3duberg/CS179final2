                5/5. OH MY GOD!!! This was the best workout I have ever done in my life. I would recommend Mark to anyone and everyone who wants to get a good workout with weights! He is the best in the business.<br><br>
                4/5. Wow, Mark is very strong! I worked with Mark for the first time, thinking that I could lift a lot of weight. He did the workout with me to show excercises and he is a very impressive man! Love the way he helps and walks you through all of the workouts. Best workout of my life!
